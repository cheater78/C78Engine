# C78Engine
### a GameEngine Project in active Development, based on Hazel by [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno "check him out")
### ...more or less made into a bad copy xD

I'm a computer science student, using this project to learn about App development, computergraphics, rendering and cross platform software design.
I'm hoping to also include some simulation and VR-support using embedded systems one day. Documentation is something I'm working on, but u know how it is.
